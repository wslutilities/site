# Installation

## For Ubuntu/Debian/Kali Linux

Run following commands:
```bash
sudo apt install lsb-release apt-transport-https
wget -O - https://apt.patrickwu.ml/pkapt.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.patrickwu.ml/ `lsb_release -c -s` main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wslu
```

Or you can download the .deb package from release and install it using `sudo dpkg -i wslu*`.

## For OpenSUSE/SLES

```bash
sudo zypper ar -G https://rpm.patrickwu.ml/ ruapm
sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper in wslu
```

Or you can download the .rpm package from release and install it using `sudo rpm -ivh "wslu*"`.

## Install from `wsl-translinux`

`wslu` is part of [wsl-translinux](https://github.com/cerebrate/wsl-translinux) apt repository. 

Following the guidelines [Here](https://github.com/cerebrate/wsl-translinux/blob/master/README.md) to add the repository. Then you can simply run `sudo apt install wslu` to install `wslu`.

However, with lack of support, I moved my packages to my own apt repository.

## Install from source code

To install, just run the following command in the bash prompt:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrick330602/wslu/master/extras/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

To uninstall, run `uninstall.sh` in `extras/scripts` and remove the folder.

## Older version

```
git clone --branch v1.2 https://github.com/patrick330602/wslu.git ~/.wslu
cd ~/.wslu
./configure -i
```

```
git clone --branch v1.1 https://github.com/patrick330602/wslu.git
